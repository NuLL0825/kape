        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Discover the story behind CozyCup Café...</p>
        <br>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>In 2005, best friends Zaj and Maui launched "CozyCup Café" in Brooksville. 
            They fused their love for coffee and music, turning a historic building into a haven for both. 
            With live music on their stage and a diverse coffee menu, the café became a hub for artists and 
            aficionados alike. Their signature "Harmony Latte" epitomized the blend of coffee and music. 
            As time passed, more locations opened, each with its own musical charm. Brew Brothers Café stands 
            today as a testament to friendship, combining coffee, music, and community in perfect harmony.</p>
